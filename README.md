#Info
Simple program to make socket tcp connection between Java(JVM) server and C# WPF client.
 Objects are being parsed by JSON format and sended by sockets.
 Server got connection to DataBase (MySQL) and with client make something like Java RMI protocol.
 
 Later it will become chat and will be connected with simple game or games lobby.
 Game Lobby is most possible for now, but before that I need to make API for that.
 Than after lobby add some simple multiplayer games.
